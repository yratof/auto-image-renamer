# Auto-image-renamer
Rename images using deep learning

![Image for demo](images/gif.gif)

Auto-image-renamer automates the task of renaming images with meaningful names. It uses Microsoft Computer Vision API's deep learning algorithms to rename the images


## Dependencies

- Python 2/3 (Tested under Ubuntu Python 3.5) 


## Usage 

### 1) Get a Microsoft API Key for Free
[https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up "API Key").

This is a weird process, it's all AZURE based now, but you create an account. Then you need to create a cognitive service app, that will allow you to create KEYS and PATHENDS. Once you've created that, you'll get two API keys. Put one in the renamer.py and you'll be golden

Replace this key with `MICROSOFT_VISION_API_KEY` in renamer.py

### 2) Usage

`python3 renamer.py path_to_images_dir`

NOTICE: Do not use a triling slash in dir

EXAMPLE `python3 renamer.py /home/sanju/images`

### 4) Enjoy!

All the images in the given directory will be renamed with meaningful names now. 


## How It was Built

1. Find all the images in the given directory
2. Images will be sent to microsoft API, they process the image and sent back a caption.
3. Rename the files with new name from the VISION API


## Disclaimer

It uplods the images to Microsoft servers, do not use it with personal images. (or use it with caution)
